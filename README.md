## **Introduction**
Blending Board is a digital educational tool that helps students with dyslexia sound out syllables and improve reading. Users of the app can create customized digital cards which contain letters that form specific sounds in English. Learners can then flip through their set of cards to practice blending sounds together to create words. This project was created during the pandemic to help students and teachers use blending boards while learning at home. 

## **Description & Main Features**
To build the Android version of this app, I used Flutter, which is a software development kit made by Google and runs on the coding language, Dart.
